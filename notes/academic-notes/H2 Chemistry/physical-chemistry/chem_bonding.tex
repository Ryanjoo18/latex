\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{7cm}p{5cm}}
\hline\hline
\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Factors affecting bond strength} \\
\hline
\vocab{Ionic bond} & Electrostatic forces of attraction b/w oppositely charged ions in giant ionic structure & Lattice energy $\propto \dfrac{q^+ \cdot q^-}{r^++r^-}$ \\
\vocab{Metallic bond} & Electrostatic forces of attraction b/w lattice of cations \& sea of delocalised electrons in giant metallic structure & No. of valence electrons available for delocalisation per atom

Size of metal cation (cationic radius) \\
\vocab{Covalent bond} & Electrostatic forces of attraction b/w positively charged nuclei of two atoms \& shared pair of electrons in simple/giant molecular structure (formed due to orbital overlap) & Bond dissociation energy, affected by:

Bond order (no. of bonds)
Effectiveness of orbital overlap: 
larger orbital is more diffused → orbital overlap less effective → shorter bond length → weaker bond strength
Bond length: sigma bond vs pi bond
Polar VS non-polar bond
 \\
\vocab{Dative bond} & Electrostatic forces of attraction b/w positively charged nuclei of donor and acceptor atom \& shared pair of electrons 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Donor}: lone pair of electrons available for donation (electron-rich)
\item \textbf{Acceptor}: vacant low-lying orbital to accept electron pair (electron-deficient)
\end{itemize} &  \\

\section*{Question Types}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mechanism question}

Remember to indicate: arrows, dipole moments, lone pairs

\item \textbf{Synthesis question}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Change in functional group
	
	Method 1: Change the functional group by substitution. If the functional group cannot be substituted to give the desired compound in a single step, substitute the functional group into another functional group that can undergo substitution readily (e.g.
	halogenoalkane)
	
	Method 2: Convert the functional group by oxidation/reduction if the starting compound cannot undergo substitution.
	
	\item Change in position of functional group (may or may not be the same as starting reagent)
	
	Step 1: Convert the starting reagent into an alkene by elimination of the functional group.
	
	Step 2: Add the new functional group (same or different) back to the alkene.
	
	\item Increase in carbon chain length
	
	Method 1: Electrophilic substitution of nitrile group onto compound with halogen group. Nitrile group can be further converted into amine or carboxylic acid group.
	[This method does not increase the number of functional groups in the compound.]
	
	Method 2: Electrophilic Add the nitrile group into the compound using HCN. (i.e. The compound needs to have a carbonyl group already) The product formed will contain a hydroxyl group adjacent to the nitrile group. The nitrile group can be further converted into amine or carboxylic acid functional group.
	[This method increases the number of functional groups in the compound by 1.]
	
	Method 3: Employ other reactions that will increase in number of carbon atoms by more than one. (e.g. Reaction of alcohol with carboxylic acid, phenol with acyl chloride, amine with acyl chloride)
	
	\item Decrease in carbon chain length
	
	Method 1: Oxidise the alkene to rupture the \ce{C=C} double bond.
	
	Method 2: Oxidise the compound that contain \ce{CH3CH(OH){-}} group or the \ce{CH3CO{-}} group using alkaline \ce{I2(aq)}. This reduces the number of carbon atoms by one.
	
	Method 3: Hydrolysis of esters and amides.

\subsection{Hybridisation}
One of 2s electron is promoted to empty 2p orbital (from ground state to excited state)
â†’ 4 singly occupied orbitals for forming 4 covalent bonds

\begin{exercise}{A-Level 2021/III/2(e)}{}
Describe and explain, in terms of orbital overlap, the shape and bonding in an ethyne molecule \ce{C2H2}. \hfill \textbf{[3]}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}[Answer]
Ethyne molecule is linear whereby all four atoms lie in a straight line. 

Both carbons are sp-hybridised. In an sp-hybridised carbon, 2s orbital combines with 2p$_x$ orbital to form two hybrid orbitals that are oriented at an angle of $180\degree$ with respect to each other, along $x$-axis. 2p$_y$ and 2p$_z$ orbitals remain unhybridised, orientated perpendicularly along $y$- and $z$-axes respectively.

\ce{C-C} $\sigma$ bond is formed by the overlap of one sp orbital from each carbon atom. Two \ce{C-H} $\sigma$ bonds are formed by overlap of the second sp orbital on each carbon with 1s orbital on hydrogen atom. \ce{C#C} bond is formed by overlap of 2p$_y$ and 2p$_z$ orbitals of each carbon atom overlap sideways to form two $\pi$ bonds between the carbons.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{A-Level 2017/II/7(a)(iii)}{}
Describe the hybridisation of the orbitals in, and the bonds between, the carbon atoms within a naphthalene molecule. \hfill \textbf{[3]}
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}[Answer]
One of the 2s electrons in each carbon atom is promoted to the vacant 2p orbital, and the 2s orbital and two 2p orbitals hybridise to give three sp$^2$ hybrid orbitals.

Adjacent carbon atoms are bonded by a $\sigma$ bond through head-on overlapping of sp$^2$ hybrid orbitals, and a $\pi$ bond through sideways overlapping of unused p$_z$ orbital of each carbon atom, that is \ce{C=C} bond. Due to delocalisation of electrons, all carbon atoms are covalently bonded by sp$^2$--sp$^2$ overlap.
\end{proof}

\section{Isomerism}
\begin{defn}{Isomers}{}
Compounds having same molecular formula but different arrangement of atoms.
\end{defn}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Structural isomerism}

Compound X has no effect on the plane of polarised light. Explain your reasoning. \hfill \textbf{[1]}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}[Answer]
Diene can attack sp$^2$ carbon on \ce{C=C} bond of the substituted alkene from both top and bottom of the plane with equal probability, since it is trigonal planar.

As such, a racemic mixture is obtained which is optically inactive since optical activity of one enantiomer exactly cancels the other.

\part{Hydrocarbons}
\section{Alkanes}
\subsection*{Chemical properties}
Generally unreactive
\begin{itemize}
\item Fully saturated: all carbon atoms are sp$^3$ hybridised and \ce{C-C}, \ce{C-H} bonds are strong and difficult to break, so alkanes \emph{do not undergo addition}.
\item \ce{C-H} bonds are non-polar: lack electron-rich ($\delta-$) and electron-deficient ($\delta+$) sites, so alkanes are \emph{unreactive towards polar reagents}.
\end{itemize}

Small cycloalkanes (e.g. cyclopropane, cyclobutane) are unstable due to \textbf{ring strain}, as molecules are forced into smaller bond angles.

\item Carbon atoms in C=C bond are unsaturated: sp2 hybridised, can bond with one more atom â†’ undergo electrophilic addition

\section{Benzene}
\subsection*{Chemical properties}
Resonance stability
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to overlapping p-orbitals, delocalised $\pi$ electron cloud above and below plane of ring. Benzene is resonance stabilised, resonance structure of benzene is very stable i.e. aromaticity.
\item Do not undergo reactions that destroy resonance stability (even through electron-rich due to presence of $\pi$ electrons), e.g. electrophilic addition. Hence benzene only undergoes electrophilic substitution, remain resonance stabilised.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Steric:} tertiary halogenoalkane has three bulky groups which hinder approach of nucleophile to electron-deficient carbon atom, more steric hindrance & \textbf{Steric:} methyl and primary halogenoalkane have no or only one alkyl group which allows easy approach of nucleophile to electron-deficient carbon atom, less steric hindrance \\

\item Free radical substitution of alkane
\item Electrophilic addition of alkene
\item Nucleophilic substitution of alcohol
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Reactivities of Halogenoalkanes}
Down the group, atomic orbital of halogen atom becomes more diffused, effectiveness of orbital overlap decreases, strength of \ce{C-X} bond decreases down the group, relative ease of breaking \ce{C-X} bond increases, reactivity of \ce{R-X} towards nucleophilic substitution increases

\begin{remark}
Do not use bond polarity to explain.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Uses}
Fluoroalkanes and fluorohalogenoalkanes are generally stable and unreactive (chemically inert) due to strong \ce{C-F} bond (high bond energy), used as \textbf{inert materials} in fire extinguisher, refrigerant, aerosol propellant etc.

\textbf{Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)} lead to ozone depletion, by free radical substitution:
\[ \ce{CFCl3 -> Cl. + .CFCl2} \]
\[ \ce{Cl. + O3 -> ClO. + O2} \]
\[ \ce{ClO. + O. -> Cl. + O2} \]
\pagebreak

\section{Halogenoarene}
\subsection*{Chemical properties}
Unreactive towards nucleophilic substitution
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Electronic:}

p orbital of halogen atom overlaps with p-orbitals of carbon atoms on benzene ring. Lone pair of electrons in p-orbital of halogen atom delocalises into benzene ring to form delocalised $\pi$ electron cloud.

\emph{Partial double bond character} in \ce{C-X} bond, more energy required to break stronger \ce{C-X} bond to displace halogen atom.

\item \textbf{Steric:}

Rear side of \ce{C-X} bond is blocked by bulky benzene ring. $\pi$ electron cloud of benzene ring repulses lone pair of electrons of nucleophile, difficult for nucleophile to attack.

(d) explain the relative basicities of ammonia, ethylamine and phenylamine in aqueous medium, in terms of
their structures
(e) describe the reaction of phenylamine with aqueous bromine
(f) describe the formation of amides from the condensation reaction between RNH2 and R'COCl
(g) explain why an amide is neutral in terms of delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen
(h) describe the chemistry of amides, exemplified by the following reactions:
(i) hydrolysis on treatment with aqueous alkali or acid
(ii) reduction to amines with lithium aluminium hydride
(i) describe the acid/base properties of amino acids and the formation of zwitterions
[knowledge of isoelectric points is not required]
(j) describe the formation of peptide (amide) bonds between $\alpha$-amino acids, and hence explain protein formation
(k) describe the hydrolysis of proteins

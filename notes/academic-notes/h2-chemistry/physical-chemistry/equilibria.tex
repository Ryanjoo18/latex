\section{Chemical Equilibria}
\subsection{Dynamic equilibrium}
\begin{defn}{Dynamic equilibrium}{}
The state of a reversible process at which the rates of forward and backward reactions are equal, but not equal to zero.

No change in concentrations of reactants and products, i.e. $k_f=k_b$.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Equilibrium Law and Equilibrium Constants}

\subsubsection{Equilibrium constants}
For a reaction with equation \ce{aA + bB <=> cC + dD}, the equilibrium constant, in concentrations, is given by
\begin{equation}
K_C = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}
\end{equation}

In pressures, the equilibrium constant is given by
\begin{equation}
K_p = \frac{{P_C}^c{P_D}^d}{{P_A}^a{P_B}^b}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
K_C=\frac{k_f}{k_b}
\end{equation}

Recall that the partial pressure of gas is given by
\begin{equation}
P_A=\frac{n_A}{n_T}P_T
\end{equation}

Degree of dissociation of A
\begin{equation}
\alpha=\frac{n_{A,\text{dissociated}}}{n_{A,\text{initial}}}
\end{equation}

The position of equilibrium is related to $K_C$.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{11cm}|}
\hline
$K_C>1$ & More products at equilibrium,

reaction proceeds in forward direction to larger extent,

POE lies to the right. \\
\hline
$K_C<1$ & More reactants at equilibrium,

reaction proceeds in backward direction to larger extent,

POE lies to the left. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To do calculations, use the \textbf{ICE table}.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& A & B & C & D \\
\hline
Initial moles / mol & & & & \\
\hline
Change in moles / mol & & & & \\
\hline
Equilibrium moles / mol & & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{remark}
Note when to use moles, concentration, or partial pressure; use moles when total pressure is not constant.
\end{remark}

Gibbs free energy change
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{11cm}|}
\hline
$\Delta G<0$ & Forward is spontaneous

$K > 1$, POE lies to right \\
\hline
$\Delta G=0$ & Equilibrium

$K = 1$ \\
\hline
$\Delta G>0$ & Backward is spontaneous

$K < 1$, POE lies to left \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Le Chatelier's Principle}

\begin{defn}{Le Chatelierâ€™s Principle}{}
If a system at dynamic equilibrium is subjected to a change which disturbs the equilibrium, the system responds in such a way so as to counteract the effect of the change to re-establish equilibrium.
\end{defn}

Change in concentration
Change in pressure
Change in temperature
Addition of catalyst

\subsection{Haber Process}
\[ \ce{N2(g) + 3 H2(g) <=> 2 NH3(g)} \]

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{7.5cm}p{7.5cm}}
\hline\hline
\textbf{Temperature} & \textbf{Pressure} \\
\hline
Expectation: reaction is favoured by low temperature & Expectation: reaction is favoured by high pressure \\
\hline
Reality: High temperature used for higher rate of reaction, economical production & Reality: Low pressure used, as high cost of maintaining equipment for high pressure \\

\chapter{Probability waves}
Particles as waves: relationship between the frequency and energy, and between the wave vector and momentum. energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms (circular orbits only) and of parabolic potentials; quantisation of angular momentum.
Uncertainty principle for the conjugate pairs of time and energy, and of coordinate and momentum (as a theorem, and as a tool for estimates);

\chapter{Structure of matter}
Emission and absorption spectra for hydrogen-like atoms (for other atoms â€” qualitatively), and for molecules due to molecular oscillations; spectral width and lifetime of excited states. Pauli exclusion principle for Fermi particles. Particles (knowledge of charge and spin): electrons, electron neutrinos, protons, neutrons, photons; Compton scattering. Protons and neutrons as compound particles. Atomic nuclei, energy levels of nuclei (qualitaively); alpha-, beta- and gamma-decays; fission, fusion and neutron capture; mass defect; half life and exponential decay. photoelectric effect.

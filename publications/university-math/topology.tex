\chapter{Metric Spaces}
\section{Definition}
\begin{defn}{Metric space}{}
A \textbf{metric space} is a pair $(X,d)$ consisting of a set of \textbf{points} $X$ and a \textbf{metric} $d:X \times X \to \RR_{\ge 0}$. For all $x,y,z \in X$, the distance function $d$ satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{M\arabic*}]
\item \textbf{Positive definitive}: $d(x,y) \ge 0$ with equality if and only if $x=y$.
\item \textbf{Symmetric}: $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
\item \textbf{Triangle inequality}: $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{notation}
We usually abbreviate $(X,d)$ as just $X$.
\end{notation}

\begin{exmp}{Metric spaces of $\RR$}{} 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The real line $\RR$ is a metric space under the metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$.
\item The interval $[0,1]$ is also a metric space with the same distance function.
\item In fact, any subset $S \subseteq \RR$ can be made into a metric space in this way.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}{Metric spaces of $\RR^2$}{} 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item We can make $\RR^2$ into a metric space by imposing the Euclidean distance function
\[ d((x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2)) = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2} \]
\item Just like with the first example, any subset $S \subseteq \RR^2$ can be made into a metric space, such as the unit disk, unit circle, and the unit square $[0,1]^2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}{Metric spaces of $\RR^n$}{}
To generalise the above examples, for positive integer $n$,
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Let $\RR^n$ be the metric space whose points are points in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, and whose metric is the Euclidean metric
\[ d((a_1,\dots,a_n),(b_1,\dots,b_n)) = \sqrt{(a_1-b_1)^2 + \cdots + (a_n-b_n)^2} \]
This is the $n$-dimensional \textbf{Euclidean space}.
\item The open unit ball $B^n$ is the subset of $\RR^n$ consisting of the points $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ such that $x_1^2+\cdots+x_n^2<1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exmp}

\begin{notation}
We will refer to $\RR^n$ with the Euclidean metric by just $\RR^n$; if we wish to take the metric space for a subset $S \subseteq \RR^n$ with the inherited metric, we will just write $S$.
\end{notation}
\pagebreak

\section{Convergence}
Since we can talk about the distance between two points, we can talk about what it means for a sequence of points to converge. This is the same as the typical epsilon--delta definition, with absolute values replaced by the distance function.

\begin{defn}{Convergence}{}
Let $(x_n)_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of points in a metric space $X$. We say that $x_n$ \textbf{converges} to $x$ if the following condition holds: for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ (depending on $\epsilon$) such that $d(x_n,x) < \epsilon$ for each $n \ge N$. This is written as
\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = x. \]
We say that a sequence converges in $X$ if it converges to a point in $X$.
\end{defn}
\pagebreak

\section{Continuity}
From calculus, the $\epsilon$--$\delta$ definition of a continuous function is
\begin{quote}
A function $f: \RR \to \RR$ is continuous at a point $p \in \RR$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $|x-p| < \delta \implies |f(x)-f(p)| < \epsilon$.
\end{quote}

For the definition in metric space, all we have do is replace the absolute values with the more general distance functions: this gives us a definition of continuity for any function $M \to N$.

\begin{defn}{Continuity}{}
For metric spaces $X = (X, d_X)$ and $Y = (Y, d_Y)$, a function $f:X \to Y$ is \textbf{continuous} at a point $p \in X$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
\[ d_X(x,p) < \delta \implies d_Y(f(x), f(p)) < \epsilon. \]
Moreover, the function $f$ is continuous if it is continuous at every point $p \in X$.
\end{defn}

Here is an equivalent condition for sequences.

\begin{thrm}{Sequential continuity}{}
A function $f:X \to Y$ of metric spaces is \textbf{continuous} at a point $p \in X$ if and only if the following property holds: if $x_1, x_2, \dots$ is a sequence in $X$ converging to $p$, then the sequence $f(x_1), f(x_2), \dots$ in $Y$ converges to $f(p)$.
\end{thrm}

\begin{proposition}[Composition of continuous functions is continuous]
Let $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to Z$ be continuous maps of metric spaces. Then their composition $g \circ f$ is continuous.
\end{proposition}
\pagebreak

\section{Structures}
Let $X$ be a metric space. All points and sets mentioned below are understood to be elements and subsets of $X$ respectively.
\begin{itemize}
\item A \vocab{ball} in $\RR^n$ is determined by its center $x\in\RR^n$ and its radius $r>0$, and is denoted by $B(x,r)$.
\[ B(x,r) = \{p \in X \mid d(x,p) < r\} \]

A \vocab{punctured ball} in $\RR^n$ is a ball excluding its center, and is denoted by $B_0(x,r)$.

\item $A$ containing $x$ is a \vocab{neighborhood} of $x$ if $B(x,\epsilon) \subset A$ for some $\epsilon>0$.

\item The \vocab{complement} of $A$, denoted by $A^c$, is the set of all points $x \in X$ such that $x \notin A$.

\item A point $x \in A$ is an \vocab{interior point} of $A$ if $A$ is a neighbourhood of $x$.

The \vocab{interior} of $A$, denoted by $A^\circ$, is the set of all interior points in $A$.

$A$ is \vocab{open} if every point of $A$ is an interior point of $A$, i.e. $A^\circ=A$.

\item A point $x\in A$ is a \vocab{limit point} of $A$ if every neighborhood of $x$ contains a point $y \neq x$ such that $y \in A$.

This means $B_0(x,\epsilon) \cap A \neq \emptyset$ for all $\epsilon>0$.

The \vocab{induced set} of $A$, denoted by $A^\prime$, is the set of all limit points of $A$.

The \vocab{closure} of $A$, denoted by $\bar{A}$, is the union set $A\cup A^\prime$. $A$ is \vocab{closed} if all limit points of $A$ are contained in $A$, i.e. $\bar{A}=A$.

\item A point $x \in A$ is an \vocab{isolated point} of $A$ if $x$ is not a limit point of $A$.

\item The \vocab{boundary} of a set $A$, denoted by $\partial A$, is the set difference $\bar{A}\setminus A^\circ$.

A point $x$ is a \vocab{boundary point} of $A$ if $x\in\partial A$.

\item A point $x$ is an \vocab{exterior point} of $A$ if it is an interior point of $A^c$.

\item $A$ is \vocab{perfect} if $A$ is closed and if every point of $A$ is a limit point of $A$.

\item $A$ is \vocab{bounded} if there is a real number $M$ and a point $p \in X$ such that $d(x,p) < M$ for all $x \in A$.

\item $A$ is \vocab{compact} if it is a bounded closed set.

\item $A$ is \vocab{dense} in $X$ if every point of $X$ is a limit point of $A$, or a point of $A$ (or both).

\item A subset $B\subset A$ is a \vocab{dense subset} of $A$ if $\bar{B}=A$.

\item $A$ is \vocab{nowhere dense} if its closure has no interior, i.e. $(\bar{A})^\circ=\emptyset$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
It is important to take note that the terminology of neighbourhood in Rudin is actually just a ball here.

This is actually standard in calculus, but I am using the terminology as you would see them in general point-set topology.
\end{remark}

\begin{thrm}{}{}
Every neighborhood is an open set.
\end{thrm}

\begin{proof}
Consider a neighborhood $E=N_r(p)$, and let $q$ be any point of $E$. Then there is a positive real number $h$ such that
\[ d(p,q) = r-h. \]
For all points $s$ such that $d(q,s)<h$, we have then
\[ d(p,s) \le d(p,q) + d(q,s) < r - h + h = r, \]
so $s \in E$. Hence $q$ is an interior point of $E$.
\end{proof}

These are certain properties regarding open and closed sets in $\RR^n$:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{P\arabic*}]
\item \textbf{A is open if and only if $A^c$ is closed}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Forward direction}:
Let $A$ be open, we consider the punctured balls of $x \notin A$ (if $x \notin A$, we consider the punctured balls centered at $x$).

Our goal is to show that $B_0(x,r)$ always intersects with $A^c$

So suppose otherwise that $B_0(x,\epsilon)$ is a subset of A for some $\epsilon>0$

Ah no sorry, we consider x not in $A^c$

The thing is we want to show that $A^c$ is closed, i.e. all limit points of $A^c$ are in $A^c$

So suppose otherwise that $x$ is a limit point of $A^c$ that is not in $A^c$

$x$ is a limit point of $A^c$, hence for all $\epsilon>0$, $B_0(x,\epsilon)$ always intersects with $A^c$

This is equivalent to saying that $B_0(x,\epsilon)$ is never a subset of $(A^c)^c=A$

However, $x$ is not in $x \notin A^c$, so $x \in A$.

But if A is open, then there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $B(x,\epsilon)$ is a subset of $A$, a contradiction

\textbf{Backward direction}: Let $A^c$ be closed. Suppose otherwise that $A$ is not open, i.e. there is a point $x\in A$ such that $B(x,\epsilon)$ is never a subset of $A$; that is to say, $B(x,\epsilon)$ always intersects with $A^c$

Since $x \in A$, then $B(x,\epsilon) \cap A^c = B_0(x,\epsilon) \cap A^c$

But this means that $B_0(x,\epsilon) \cap A^c$ is never empty, hence $x$ is a limit point of $A^c$.

However, $x \in A$, contradictory to $A^c$ being closed and thus should contain all of its limit points
\end{proof}

\item \textbf{An arbitrary union of open sets is open; a finite intersection of open sets is open.}

\begin{proof}
Let $A$ be an arbitrary union of open sets $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$.

Then for any $x \in A$, suppose that $x \in U_i$, then since $U_i$ is open we can pick $B(x,\epsilon)$ subset of $U_i$ subset of $A$

On the other hand, let $U$ and $V$ be open sets and let $x \in U \cap V$. 
Since $U$ and $V$ are open, we can pick $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ such that $B(x,\epsilon_1)$ is in $U$ whereas $B(x,\epsilon_2)$ is in $V$. 
Then we simply pick $\epsilon=\min\{\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2\}$ so that $B(x,\epsilon)$ is in $U \cap V$.
\end{proof}

\item \textbf{An arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed; a finite union of closed sets is closed.}

\begin{proof}
This follows from de Morgan's Law on P1 and P2.
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prbm}
Compare the sizes of the following pairs of sets, i.e. determine if they are equal, or if one set may be a subset of the other.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(A\cup B)^\circ$, $A^\circ\cup B^\circ$
\item $(A\cap B)^\circ$, $A^\circ\cap B^\circ$
\item $\overline{A\cup B}$, $\bar{A}\cup\bar{B}$
\item $\overline{A\cap B}$, $\bar{A}\cap\bar{B}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{prbm}

\begin{proof} \
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(A\cup B)^\circ$ may be bigger

In $\RR$ we consider the intervals $A=(-1,0]$ and $B=[0,1)$, then
\[ A^\circ\cup B^\circ=(-1,0)\cup(0,1), \quad (A\cup B)^\circ=(-1,1) \]

For $x \in A^\circ \cup B^\circ$, we have either $x \in A^\circ$ or $x \in B^\circ$, so there is some ball centered at $x$ that is contained in either $A$ or $B$ and thus must be contained in $A\cup B$ as well.

\item Equal

If $x \in (A\cap B)^\circ$, then there exists a ball $U$ centered at $x$ such that $U$ is in both $A$ and $B$, so $x$ is in both $A^\circ$ and $B^\circ$.

On the other hand, $A^\circ\cap B^\circ$ is a subset of $A\cap B$; taking the interior of both sides, then since the intersection between two open sets is open we find that $A^\circ\cap B^\circ$ is a subset of $(A\cap B)^\circ$.

\item Equal

\item $\bar{A}\cap\bar{B}$ may be bigger
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{prbm}
Prove that the set of exterior points, $(A^c)^\circ$ is the same as $(\bar{A})^c$.
\end{prbm}

\begin{proof}
\begin{align*}
&x \in (A^c)^\circ \\
&\iff \exists \epsilon>0 \text{ such that } B(x,\epsilon) \subset A^c \\
&\iff B(x,\epsilon) \cap A = \emptyset \\
&\iff x \notin A \text{ and } B_0(x,\epsilon) \cap A=\emptyset \\
&\iff x \notin A \cup A^\prime = \bar A \\
&\iff x \in (\bar A^c)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{prbm}
Regarding alternative descriptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A$ is a neighbourhood of x if and only if there exists an open set U such that x is in U, U is subset of A (trivial except you'll actually need to prove that balls are open sets).
\item If $x$ is a limit point of $A$, then in fact for any $\epsilon>0$, $B(x,\epsilon)$ contains infinitely many elements of $A$ (you don't need to mention the punctured ball here because of obvious reasons; converse is trivial but a good and intuitive description).
\item $x$ is a boundary point of $A$ if and only if for all $\epsilon>0$, $B(x,\epsilon)$ intersects with both $A$ and $A^c$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prbm}

\begin{proof} \ {\\}
\begin{enumerate}
\item We show that $B(x,\epsilon)$ is open:

$\forall y \in B(x,\epsilon)$, 
\[ |y-x|<\epsilon \]

$\forall z \in B(y,\epsilon-|y-x|)$, 
\[ |z-x|\le|z-y|+|y-x|<\epsilon-|y-x|+|y-x|=\epsilon \]

$\therefore\:B(y,\epsilon-|y-x|) \subset B(x,\epsilon)$

\item We construct a sequence $\{x_n\}$ recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pick $x_1 \in B_0(x,\epsilon) \cap A$
\item Pick $x_{n+1} \in B_0(x,|x_n-x|) \cap A$
\end{itemize}
It is easy to see that the balls above are getting smaller so all $x_n$ are both mutually distinct and all contained in $B(x,\epsilon)$.

\item $x$ is a boundary point if and only if $x \in \bar{A} \setminus A^\circ$

\textbf{Forward direction}: 

We consider two cases
\begin{itemize}
\item $x \in A$, then all $B(x,\epsilon)$ intersects with $A$ at $x$, but since x is not in $A^\circ$ they must always intersect with $A^c$ as well.
\item $x \notin A$, then all $B(x,\epsilon)$ intersect with $A^c$ at $x$, but since $x \in \bar{A}$, $x$ is a limit point of $A$ and thus $B(x,\epsilon)$ always intersects with $A$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Backward direction}:

We consider two cases
\begin{itemize}
\item $x \in A$, then since $B(x,\epsilon)$ always intersects with $A^c$, $x$ cannot be in $A^\circ$.
\item $x \notin A$, then since $B(x,\epsilon)$ always intersects with $A$, $x$ must be in $\bar{A}$.
\end{itemize}

In fact we can describe the closure without referring to punctured balls and induced sets:
$x \in \bar{A}$ if and only if $B(x,\epsilon)$ always intersects with $A$

Also as a side note, $A\circ\cup dA\cup (A^c)\circ=\RR^n$
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{prbm}
Regarding closures (The following properties are relatively nontrivial compared to its 'open-set' counterparts):
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item $A^\prime$ is closed.
\item $\bar{A}$ is closed, i.e. bar(barA)=barA
\end{enumerate}
\end{prbm}

\begin{proof} \ {\\}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item In order to show that $A^\prime$ is closed, we need to show that if $x$ is a limit point of $A^\prime$, then $x\in A^\prime$, i.e. $x$ is a limit point of $A$.

So we need to show that limit points of $A^\prime$ are always limit points of $A$: 
Let $x$ be a limit point of $A^\prime$, then for all $\epsilon>0$, $B_0(x,\epsilon/2)$ intersects with $A^\prime$ and we may pick $y \in B_0(x,\epsilon/2)\cap A^\prime$

Now here's the tricky part
Since $y \in A^\prime$, y is a limit point of $A$, hence $B_0(y,|y-x|)$ intersects with $A$ and thus we may pick $z \in B_0(y,|y-x|)\cap A$.

We show that $z \in B_0(x,\epsilon)$:
\[ |z-x|\le|z-y|+|y-x|<2|y-x|<\epsilon, \]
hence $z \in B(x,\epsilon)$.
\[ |z-y|<|x-y|, \]
hence $z \neq x$

$\therefore\:z \in B_0(x,\epsilon)$

\item As for 5-2, it is just 5-1 and 2-3
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

For homework, you'll work out some properties regarding dense sets

1. $A$ is a dense set in $X$ if and only if $A$ intersects with all open sets in $X$.
2. If $A$ is dense in $X$ and $B$ is dense in $A$, then $B$ is dense in $X$
3. If $A$ and $B$ are dense in $X$ where $A$ is open, then $A\cap B$ is dense in $X$

\section{Open sets}
\begin{defn}{Neighbourhood}{}
For metric space $X$ and point $p \in X$, an \vocab{$r$-neighborhood} of $p$, denoted by $N_r(p)$, is the set of all $q$ with $d(p,q) < r$ for some radius $r > 0$.
\[ N_r(p) = \{q \in X \mid d(p,q) < r \} \]
\end{defn}

\begin{remark}
Others define a neighborhood as any set that contains one of these neighborhoods, which are instead called ``the open ball of radius $r$ about $p$".
\end{remark}

Such an open ball is sometimes referred to as the open neighborhood of $p$ of radius $r$.

Open balls are instances of open sets.

\begin{defn}{Open set}{}
A subset $U \subset X$ is open if, for every point $x \in U$, there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $B_{\epsilon}(x) \subset U$.
\end{defn}

The idea is that, in a open set, there exists a ``safety margin" around every point. Given a point $p$, one can \emph{move around in the set a certain distance and remain} in the sense.

\end{figure}

\section{Compactness}
\begin{defn}{Open cover}{}
By an \textbf{open cover} of a set $A$ in a metric space $X$ we mean a collection $\{G_\alpha\}$ of open subsets of $X$ such that $A \subset \bigcup_\alpha G_\alpha$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Compact set}{}
A subset $K$ of a topological (or metric) space is compact if every open cover of $K$ has a \emph{finite} subcover.
\end{defn}

An open cover of $A$ is a collection of open sets that collectively cover $A$.

A subcover is a subcollection of these open sets that still collectively cover $A$.

This means that any infinite collection of open sets that together cover a compact set always ``overcovers" it.

The simplest kind of compact set is just a finite set: a collection of finitely many points.

\pagebreak

\section{Some theorems}
\begin{thrm}{Cantor's Intersection Theorem}{}
Given a decreasing sequence of compact sets $A_1\supset A_2 \supset \cdots$, there exists a point $x\in\RR^n$ such that $x$ belongs to all $A_i$. In other words, $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i\neq\emptyset$. Moreover, if for all $i\in\NN$ we have $\diam A_{i+1}\le c\cdot\diam A_k$ for some constant $c<1$, then such a point must be unique, i.e. $\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_k=\{x\}$ for some $x\in\RR^n$.
\end{thrm}

\begin{thrm}{Heine-Borel Theorem}{}
A set $A\subset\RR^n$ is compact if and only if every open covering has a finite subcover, i.e. for any family of open sets $\mathscr{U}=\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ satisfying $A\subset\bigcup_{i\in I}U_i$, there exists $\{U_1,\dots,U_n\}\subset\mathscr{U}$ such that $A\subset\bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i$.
\end{thrm}

\begin{thrm}{Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem}{}
Infinite bounded sets in $\RR^n$ must contain limit points.
\end{thrm}

\begin{proof}
We will follow a very specific sequence of steps to prove them:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cantor Intersection for $n=1$
\item Bolzano-Weierstrass for $n=1$
\item Bolzano-Weierstrass for general $n$
\item Cantor Intersection for general $n$
\item Heine-Borel for general $n$
\end{enumerate}

Proof:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that there is a decreasing sequence of compact sets $A_1, A_2, \dots$ in the real numbers

Since $A_k$ are bounded, we may let $a_k=\inf A_k$
Also since $A_k$ are closed, $a_k \in A_k$

Note that since $A_k$ is a decreasing sequence of sets we have $a_1\le a_2\le\dots$

Also, whenever we have $n>k$, we have $a_n \in A_n$, but $A_n \subset A_k$ and thus $a_n \in A_k$.

Let $b_1=\sup A_1$, then $a_k \in A_1$ and thus $a_k\le b_1$ for all $k$.

This tells us that the sequence $\{a_k\}$ is bounded above, and thus we may let $a=\sup a_k$.

Our goal is to show that the number $a$ appears in all $A_k$, thus showing that the entire intersection $\bigcap A_k$ contains $a$ and thus must be non-empty.

Now we split this in two cases, which asks whether a is simply made from isolated points, or if it is actually some nontrivial point obtained from the boundaries of $A_k$

\textbf{Case 1:} $a_k=a$ for some $k$
In this case we see that $a_k\le a_n\le a$ for all $n>k$ and thus $a_n=a$ in this case, therefore a is an element in $A_n$ for all $n$

In this case you can imagine that there is a possibility where a is an isolated minimum point of $A_n$ which stays there forever in the decreasing sequence of sets

\textbf{Case 2:} $a_k<a$ for all $k$; in this case we see that $a$ is the limit point of the increasing sequence $\{a_k\}$

Exercise 1: Show that $a$ is a limit point of each $A_k$.

Note that $a_n$ is in $A_k$ for each $n>k$, and since $a=\sup\{a_k\}$ where $a_k$ is increasing, we can actually show that a is a limit point of $\{a_n \mid n \le k\}$:
For every $\epsilon>0$, we pick $n_0$ such that $0 < a-a_{n_0} < \epsilon$
Pick $n\prime > \max\{k,n_0\}$, then $a_{n^\prime} \ge a_{n_0}$ and so
\[ 0<a-a_n\prime \le a_{n_0} < \epsilon \]
This shows that there exists $a_n^\prime$ in $B_0(a,\epsilon) \cap \{a_n \mid n>k\}$ for all $\epsilon$, and so $a$ is a limit point of $\{a_n \mid n>k\}$.

Now since $\{a_n|n \ge k\}$ is a subset of $A_k$ we also see that a is a limit point of $A_k$
Finally, since $A_k$ is closed, we conclude that $a$ is in $A_k$ for all $k$, and we are done

Wait hold on, I forgot about the second part

Now we consider a decreasing sequence of compact sets $A_1, A_2, \dots$ such that $\diam A_{k+1} \le c \diam A_k$ for $c<1$.

Suppose otherwise that there exists $x, y$ in $\bigcap A_k$

You can imagine that this will form a fixed distance between two points, and thus there is a constant positive lower bound for the diameters:
\[ \diam A_k \ge |x-y| > 0 \forall k \]

But this cannot be true because $\diam A_{k+1} \le c \diam A_k$ and so the diameter is controlled by a decreasing geometric sequence:
\[ \diam A_{k+1} \le c^k \diam A_1 \]

So we can simply pick a natural number $k$ such that
\[ k > \log_c \frac{|x-y|}{\diam A_1} \]

\item We consider an infinite bounded set $A$ in the real numbers. Since $A$ is bounded, we can pick a closed interval $[a_1,b_1]$ containing $A$.

We then perform a series of binary cuts: Consider the two halves of $[a_1,b_1]$. We know that at least one of these two must contain infinitely many elements in $A$, otherwise $A$ cannot be infinite. We pick this half of the interval and denote it by $[a_2,b_2]$. We continue this to pick a decreasing sequence of closed intervals $[a_n,b_n]$.

Now $\diam [a_{n+1},b_{n+1}] = \frac{1}{2} \diam [a_n,b_n]$, so by the Cantor Intersection Theorem, there exists a unique real number $c$ in the intersection $\bigcap[a_n,b_n]$.

We show that this $c$ is in fact a limit point of $A$.

For any $\epsilon>0$, we need to show that $B_0(c,\epsilon) \cap A \neq \emptyset$, i.e. we need to find an element $x \neq c$ in $A$ that is less than $\epsilon$ apart from $c$.

We then realize that we can simply exploit the decreasing sequence $[a_n,b_n]$
Since $\diam [a_n,b_n]$ is controlled by a decreasing sequence:
\[ \diam [a_{n+1},b_{n+1}] \le 1/2^n \diam [a_1,b_1] \]
We take a sufficiently large n so that $b_n-a_n<\epsilon$
Since $c$ is in $[a_n,b_n]$, for all $x$ in $[a_n,b_n]$ we have $|x-c|\le b_n-a_n<\epsilon$ and therefore $[a_n,b_n]$ is within $B(c,\epsilon)$.

Here's the funny part: $[a_n,b_n]$ contains infinitely many elements of $A$, so it must contain at least one element in A that is not $c$.

Therefore this element $x \neq c$ is in $B_0(c,\epsilon)$.

\item Now we have an infinte bounded set $A$ in $\RR^n$

The idea here is to consecutively come up with better and better sequences of points in $A$. We denote $x_i$ to be the $i$-th coordinate in $\RR^n$.

Our first wish is to pick some elements in $A$ so that they sort of converge at $x_1$.

Because such considerations of 'restricting to a single coordinate' is important here, we define the projection map to the $i$-th coordinate by
\[ f_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)=x_i \]

So, we look at $f_i(A)$ and try to apply BW for the case where $n=1$.

However, the problem is that $f_i(A)$ need not be infinite. For example, the set $\{(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),\dots\}$ projected onto the first coordinate is simply $\{0\}$.

This forces us to consider two cases

Exercise 2: Show that $f_i(A)$ is bounded
This is simple
1. $f_1(A)$ is infinite, then we can apply BW(n=1) to find a real number $c_1$ which is a limit point in $f_1(A)$

Here we can construct a sequence of points 
\[ \{x^{(1),1},x^{(1),2},...\} \]
so that their first coordinates satisfy
\[ |x^{(1),n}_1-c_1| < 1/n \]
for all natural number n
(I know this notation is cumbersome but the problem is that we need multiple sequences for this proof)

2. $f_1(A)$ is finite, then by the Pigeonhole Principle there exists a real number $c_1$ such that its preimage $f_1^{-1}(c_1)$ in $A$ is infinite

In this case we can randomly pick a sequence $\{x^{(1),1},x^{(1),2},\dots\}$ in $A$ so that their first coordinate is equal to $c_1$

I forgot to mention something that is implied, but we actually do have the need to emphasize that the sequence $\{x^{(1),1},x^{(1),2},\dots\}$ can be chosen to contain mutually distinct entries

Now that we have a sequence that behaves nice on the first coordinate, we may then move on to the second coordinate

Let $A_1=\{x^{(1),1},x^{(1),2},\dots\}$
We again consider $f_2(A_1)$ in two cases, infinite or finite

In any case, we are able to find a subsequence $\{x^{(2),1},x^{(2),2},\dots\}$, where
$x^{(2),k}=x^{(1),n_k}$ for some strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers $n_k$

So that, for the limit point/point with infinite preimage $c_2$, this sequence satisfies
\[ |f_2(x^{(2),n})-c_2| < \frac{1}{n} \]
Note that the property we have for the second case (we in fact have $f_2(x^{(2),n})=c_2$) is just a better version of this.

Now, take note that picking this subsequence does no harm whatsoever towards the first coordinate (if anything it would turn out to be better) since
\[ |f_1(x^{(2),k})-c_1| = |f_1(x^{(1),n_k}-c_1| < \frac{1}{n_k} \le \frac{1}{k} \]
($n_1<\dots<n_k$ is a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers so $n_k \ge k$)

This continues on until we obtain a sequence of points $\{x^{(n),1},x^{(n),2},\dots\}$ in $A$ so that
\[ |f_i(x^{(n),k}-c_i|<\frac{1}{k} \quad \forall i,k \]

As we can see, the point $c=(c_1,\dots,c_n)$ is in fact a limit point of $A$ as we can always choose a big enough $k$ so that $x^{(n),k}$ is in $B(c,\epsilon) \cap A$.

Since $\{x^{(n),k}\}$ was always chosen to be a sequence of distinct entries, there is no danger for this sequence to always be c, and so c must be a limit point of $A$.

\item We may now return to the general case of Cantor.

Suppose that there is a sequence of decreasing compact sets $A_1,A_2,\dots$ in $\RR^n$. 
Note that every point is contained in $A_1$, so boundedness will never be an issue here.

Since $A_k$ are all nonempty, we can simply pick any element $a_k$ from $A_k$.

For the uncannily specific case that there are only finitely many $\{a_k\}$ chosen, we simply note that, again by Pigeonhole Principle, one of the $a_k$ appears infinitely often; thus for each $A_n$ we simply pick $n_k>n$ so that $A_{n_k}$ contains $a_k$, then $a_k$ is in $A_{n_k}$ which is a subset of $A_n$.

Otherwise, we can then note that $\{a_k\}$ is an infinite bounded set of points, so there must exist a limit point a of $\{a_k\}$.

We can now see that $a$ is always an element of $A_k$:
Using the same technique as Exercise 1, we see that a is a limit point of $\{a_n \mid n>k\}$ and so is a limit point of $A_k$, therefore a is in $A_k$ as $A_k$ is closed.

This proves the first part of the statement
The second part is completely identical to the second part of the $n=1$ case so we don't need to waste our time there either

\item We now consider a compact set A with some open covering $\mathscr{U}$.

This theorem is proved by contradiction: 
Suppose otherwise that set $A$ cannot be covered by any finite collection of open sets in $\mathscr{U}$

Since $A$ is compact, we may enclose it in a closed cube $Q_1$ (whose edges are parallel to the axes)

Now, for each step, we partition $Q$ into $2^n$ cubes by cutting it in half from each direction.

Then, starting from $Q_1$, there must exist one of these smaller cubes, denoted by $Q_2$, such that $A \cap Q_2$ cannot be covered by a finite collection of open sets in $\mathscr{U}$. 
Otherwise, if each $A \cap Q$ has a finite cover, then we simply collect all of these open sets together to form a finite cover of $A$, which violates our assumption.

We continue on to partition $Q_n$ and pick $Q_{n+1}$ so that $A_{n+1}$ has no finite cover (denote $A_n = A \cap Q_n$).

Note that $A$ and $Q_n$ are both compact, so $A_n$ is compact
Also we see that there is a decreasing sequence $A_1,A_2,\dots$
(we can't exactly obtain a relation between $\diam A_n$ and $\diam A_{n+1}$ here)

By Cantor Intersection Theorem we can always find a point $x$ in $A$ located in the intersection $\bigcap A_k$.

Now, since $\mathscr{U}$ is an open covering of $A$, there exists an open set $U$ in $\mathscr{U}$ such that $x\in U$.

The final key step is to exploit the sequence of decreasing cubes $Q_n$. So even though there isn't a clear cut way to control the sizes of $\diam A_n$, we do in fact have the property that $\diam Q_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2^n} \diam Q_1$.

Therefore, by picking a sufficiently large $n$, we can obtain $Q_n$ that is contained in $U$.

But this is a contradiction. 
This is because we've specifically chosen the sequence $A_n$ to be sets that do not possess any finite cover $\{U_1,...,U_n\}$ in $\mathscr{U}$. But here $A_n$ simply would have a one-element cover $\{U\}$.

This completes our proof.

\section{Structures on Euclidean Space}
\begin{defn}{Limit and isolated point}{}
A point $p$ is a limit point of $E$ if every neighborhood of $p$ contains a point $q \neq p in E$. 

If $p$ is not a limit point but is in $E$, then $p$ is an isolated point.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Closed set}{}
$E$ is closed if every limit point of $E$ is in $E$. Intuitively, this means $E$ ``contains all its edges".

The closure $\bar{E}$ of $E$ is the union of E and the set of its limit points.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Interior point}{}
A point $p$ is an interior point of $E$ if there is a neighborhood $N$ of $p$ such that $N \subset E$. Note that interior points must be in $E$ itself, while limit points need not be.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Open set}{}
E is open if every point of E is an interior point of E. Intuitively, E “doesn’t have edges”.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Dense set}{}
E is dense in X if every point of X is a limit point of E or a point of E, or both.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}{Interior}{}
The interior $E^0$ of $E$ is the set of all interior points of $E$, or equivalently the union of all open sets contained in $E$.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Some Concepts in Euclidean Space}
\begin{defn}{Bounded set}{}
A set $E$ in $\RR^n$ is a \vocab{bounded set} if there exists $M>0$ such that $\forall x \in E,\:\norm{x} \le M$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prbm}
$E,F$ in $\RR^n$ and real $k$, define
\[ kE = \{kx \mid x \in E\} \]
\[ E+F = \{x+y \mid x \in E,y \in F\} \]
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Show that if $E$ is bounded, then $kE$ is bounded;
\item Show that if $E$ and $F$ are bounded, then $E+F$ is bounded
\end{enumerate}
\end{prbm}

\begin{defn}{Diameter of set}
Given a set $E \subset \RR^n$, the \vocab{diameter} of $E$ is defined as 
\[ \diam E = \sup_{x,y\in E} d(x,y). \]
\end{defn}

\begin{prbm}
Find the diameter of the open unit ball in $\RR^n$ given by
\[ B = \{x \in \RR^n \mid \norm{x}<1\} \]
\end{prbm}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
First note that
\[ d(x,y) = \norm{x-y} \le \norm{x}+\norm{-y} = \norm{x}+\norm{y} <1+1=2 \]

On the other hand, for any $\epsilon>0$, we pick
\[ x=(1-\frac{\epsilon}{4},0,\dots,0), y=(-\brac{1-\frac{\epsilon}{4}},0,\dots,0) \]
Then
\[ d(x,y) = 2-\frac{\epsilon}{2} > 2-\epsilon \]

Therefore $\diam B = 2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prbm}
Given a set $E$ in $\RR^n$, show that $E$ is bounded if and only if $\diam E < +\infty$.
\end{prbm}

\begin{proof}[Solution] \ {\\}
\textbf{Forward direction}:

If $E$ is bounded, then there exists $M>0$ such that $\forall x \in E$, $\norm{x} \le M$.

Thus $\forall x,y \in E$,
\[ d(x,y) = \norm{x-y} \le \norm{x} + \norm{y} \le 2M. \]
Thus $\diam E = \sup d(x,y) \le 2M < +\infty$

\textbf{Backward direction}:

Suppose that $\diam E = r$.

Pick a random point $x \in E$, suppose that $||x||=R$

Then for any other $y \in E$,
\[ \norm{y} = \norm{x+(y-x)} \le \norm{x} + \norm{y-x} \le R+r \]

Thus, by picking $M=R+r$, we obtain $\norm{y} \le M \forall y \in E$, and we're done.

Basically you use $x$ to confine $E$ within a ball, which is then confined within an even bigger ball centered at the origin.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}{Distance between sets}{}
Given two sets $E,F \subset \RR^n$, the \vocab{distance between sets} $E$ and $F$ is defined as 
\[ d(E,F) = \inf_{x\in E, y\in F}\norm{x-y}. \]
\end{defn}

Obviously $d(E,F)>0$ implies that $E$ and $F$ are disjoint, but $E$ and $F$ may still be disjoint even if $d(E,F)=0$, e.g. the closed intervals $E=(-1,0), F=(0,1)$.

\begin{prbm}
Suppose that $E$ and $F$ are sets in $\RR^n$ where $F$ is finite, then $E$ and $F$ are disjoint if and only if $d(E,F)>0$.
\end{prbm}

Topology in Euclidean Space

Before we move on, we need to talk about how we think about topology. The concept first begins with an attempt to say that two points are close to one another. 

Of course, we did define the metric earlier
But as it turns out, this particular notion can be made extremely abstract

Specifically speaking, we could theoretically define closeness simply with set theory

Imagine that in some random set X, there is a predetermined family of subsets scrA in P(X)
(scr: script; cursive)

Now for some element x in X, suppose that we can pick a set in $\mathscr{A}$ containing $x$. 

We may denote this set as U(x)
Then, from the perspective of U(x), a point y in X would seem to be close to x if y also lies in U(x)

Ah actually the family of subsets is usually denoted as $\mathscr{N}$

The family $\mathscr{N}$ is called the neighbourhood system

There is also the notion of the neighbourhood system of a particular point,
\[ \mathscr N(x) = \{U \in \mathscr{N} \mid x \in U\} \]

Now, here's the easiest part to confuse
:
The word 'system' in the above terminology is actually quite crucial
It is not named 'neighbourhood set' or 'neighbourhood family' for a reason
:
That's because the terminology of 'neighbourhood' is used as follows:
We say that a subset of X, let's say N, is a neighbourhood of x, if there is some neighbourhood $U \in \mathscr{N}$ such that $x \in U$ and $U \subset N$.
:
Ah I'm very sorry but I messed up the terminology

According to wikipedia, the neighbourhood system actually refers to all neighbourhoods
What I was talking about earlier should've been called a neighbourhood basis

:
The neighbourhood basis is denoted by scrB



Okay let's redo the entire thing

1. Neighbourhood Basis
Given a set $X$, we define a family of subsets in $X$, denoted by $scrB$, to describe points close to each other; points that belong to the same set $U$ in $scrB$ are considered to be close to each other with respect to $U$.

2. Neighbourhood
Given a point $x$ in $X$, we use the term \vocab{neighbourhood} to describe a particular construction for $x$; $N$ is said to be a neighbourhood of $x$, if there exists $U$ in $\mathscr{B}$ containing $x$ such that $U \subset N$.

2'. Neighbourhood System
Given a point $x$ in $X$, the \vocab{neighbourhood system} of $x$, denoted $\mathscr{N}(x)$, is the set of all neighbourhoods of $x$.

These are the axioms for the neighbourhood systems
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathscr{N}(x)$ is nonempty, and $\forall U \in \mathscr{N}(x), x \in U$
\item If $U,V \in \mathscr{N}(x)$, then $\exists W \in \mathscr{N}(x) \suchthat W \subset U \cap V$
\item If $U \in \mathscr{N}(x)$ and $y \in U$, then $\exists V \in \mathscr{N}(y) \suchthat V \subset U$
\end{enumerate}

As for the Euclidean plane, we have a natural way of defining the neighbourhood systems
First we pick the neighbourhood basis to be
\[ \mathscr{B} = \{B(x,\epsilon) \mid x \in \RR^n,\epsilon>0\} \]

Then we say that N is a neighbourhood of x if there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $B(x,\epsilon) \subset N$. 
$B(x,\epsilon)$ represents the points close to x, whereas a neighbourhood N of x should contain all the points close to x, at least from the perspective of $B(x,\epsilon)$

Once we have neighbourhood systems, we can then define the two most important kinds of sets in topology, open and closed sets.

\textit{``The mathematician does not study mathematics because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it and he delights in it because it is beautiful."}

\section*{About the author}
At this moment of writing, I am a high school student working on my A Level studies in Singapore. I have about 11 years of participating in Mathematics competitions, including three years of experience in mental arithmetic and the rest few years in Mathematics Olympiad.

\section*{About this book}
My initial purpose of writing this book was to summarise what I had learnt about university level Mathematics. The writing is intentionally kept simple, without large intimidating blocks of text, to ensure readability.

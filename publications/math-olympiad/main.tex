\chapter*{Preface}
\section*{About the Author}
Ryan Joo Rui An is a high school student currently completing his A Levels in Singapore. He has participated in numerous Mathematics Olympiad competitions and consistently achieved decent results, including the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad (SMO) and IMO National Selection Test (IMONST), which are the two selection tests for the prestigious International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) by Singapore and Malaysia respectively.

\section*{About the Book}
The motivation of the writer to write this book was to the author for Mathematics Olympiad competitions by summarising important topics in Mathematics Olympiad, with a focus on SMO and MAA-AMC, which feature rather challenging problems.
